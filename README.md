## What is
This is the source code for a short game that @herteljt and I made for Ludum
Dare 33. The theme of the game jam was **"You are the monster"**.

## How do I
To play the game, you can do one of two things:

### Option 1
Just [check out our shared version right here](insert link to final export here).

### Option 2
1. Go to http://www.puzzlescript.net/editor.html
2. Copy everything in `game.puzzlescript` into your clipboard.
3. Paste that into the left panel on the PuzzleScript editor.
4. Click `SAVE`, then `RUN` up at the top of the page.

## What did you
We used [Stephen Lavelle](http://www.increpare.com)'s awesome game engine
PuzzleScript. It is lots of fun to play with and you should try it out.

## Who did
Casey Brant [@BaseCase](http://twitter.com/basecase) and Josh Hertel [@herteljt](http://twitter.com/herteljt)

## What if I
We'd love to see your own new levels or tweaks to the game! Hit us up on
Twitter if you make a cool level using these mechanics and tiles!
